## Troubleshooting

Listed below are some cases where the audience may have run into unexpected situations while boiling eggs, along with possible solutions.

### The eggs cracked while putting them in the saucepan

If the audience follows the directions above, the eggs should be cooked properly and safe to consume, regardless of whether or not they are cracked prior to putting them into the saucepan. Cracked eggs that are unsightly can be discarded, if desired.

### The eggs cracked sometime during the boiling process

If cooked properly, cracked eggs that have been boiled should be safe for consumption.

A green-colored yolk indicates that the eggs have been overcooked. Overcooked eggs should be discarded and not consumed.
